# UFOs
## Overview of Project
In this module, I built a table displaying UFO sighting data. This was stored in a JavaScript array. I added filters to make this table fully dynamic and customized it with Bootstrap.

## Results
You can filter the table by date, city, country, state and/or shape of the UFO sighted. </br>
